### Alexa publishes work describing the potential of historical/ancient RNA!

Alexa wrote an opinion piece on historical RNA describing what we can potentially learn from it. You can read it [here](https://www.cell.com/trends/plant-science/fulltext/S1360-1385(24)00305-4). Also, the article was featured on the cover, image below and a huge thanks to the field museum for letting us use their sample in the photo.
