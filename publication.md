### Overview
For a complete chronological ordering of my publications please see my google scholar profile [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hSrEx9oAAAAJ&hl=en)

On this page I have listed papers based on when I worked on them/career stage, so they are not necessarily chronological.

### Cambridge Postdoctoral Publications (Nov. 2018 - Present)

Have one I'm finishing the edits for regarding data analysis and gene tree conflict, stay tuned!

### Michigan Postdoctoral Publications (Aug. 2018 - Nov. 2018)

Putting the final touches on a couple in prep, some Ericales work, edge-based analyses, and work on within gene conflict. Coming soon!
