### About

This page highlights some of the programs that have either been developed by folks in the lab or are currently in development

[Semblans](https://github.com/gladshire/Semblans/): Led by Miles Woodcock-Girard, this C++ program provides an automated way to assemble transcriptomes. The paper has now been published in bioinformatics and can be found [here](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/41/1/btaf003/7950665).

[CAnDI](https://github.com/HollyMaeRobertson/CAnDI): Led by Holly Robertson and developed in collaboration with the Moyroud group, this Python program dissects large gene families allowing you to perform conflict analyses without having to first do orthology detection. You can also search large gene families for patterns of conflict that may help explain trait evolution in the tree of life. The paper can be found [here](https://academic.oup.com/sysbio/advance-article/doi/10.1093/sysbio/syaf028/8126907?login=false).

[TreeHouse](https://github.com/karolisr/treehouse): Led by Karolis Ramanauskas and currently in development, however, it does have working releases. Treehouse simplifies tree visualization and lets you easily view and navigate extremely large trees. New features are being added regularly, so please open an issue and let Karolis know if there's anything you'd like in a tree viewer.
