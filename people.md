### Folks in the lab


### Joe Walker (PI)

My name is Joe Walker [faculty webpage here](https://bios.uic.edu/profiles/walker-joseph/). I received my BS from Purdue University in 2012, my Master’s degree from Purdue in 2014 (because who doesn’t want to stay in beautiful West Lafayette, Indiana), and my Ph.D. from the University of Michigan in 2018. I then went to the University of Cambridge as a research associate until 2021. Now I’m a faculty member who has the privilege of working with the folks listed on this page.

## Postdoc

### Karolis Ramanauskas

Karolis earned his Ph.D. from UIC in 2022. He is mainly working on applying population genetic methods to transcriptome datasets. However, he’s also pursuing a project disentangling why chloroplasts and mitochondria sometimes show conflicting phylogenetic signals. In his free time, he designs and maintains open-source software such as [kakapo](https://github.com/karolisr/kakapo).

## Graduate Students

### Alexa Tyszka

Alexa is a third-year Ph.D. candidate whose research focuses on developing new methods for obtaining transcriptomes and using them to study carnivory in Bromeliads. She completed her undergraduate degree in 2021 from UIC and joined the lab right as it started. She has received the [GRFP]( https://bios.uic.edu/news-stories/undergraduate-alexa-tyszka-awarded-national-science-foundation-graduate-research-fellowship/), the UIC research award, and the UIC graduate teaching award. You can check out her website [here]( https://atyszka.org/) and her google scholar [here]( https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=P67UxboAAAAJ).

### Eric Bretz

Eric is a second-year Ph.D. student whose research is focused on computational methods to clean up genomic data, specifically filtering out chimeras. Eric joined the Marines out of high school, then after his service, completed his undergraduate degree at UIC in 2020. He was a postbacc with Dr. Andrea McGinley Bassett for a year before deciding to join the lab. Despite only being in his second year, he has already co-first authored a paper and would have presented his work at Botany 2023 if he didn’t have his luggage accidentally sent to Denver instead of Boise. He has quickly picked up several programming languages. You can find his website [here]( https://ericbretz.weebly.com/), his linked in [here]( https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-bretz-172986210/) and his google scholar [here]( https://bios.uic.edu/profiles/bretz-eric/).

### Holly Robertson

Holly is externally co-supervised by the lab and based in Cambridge in the lab of [Edwige Moyroud](https://www.slcu.cam.ac.uk/people/edwige-moyroud), my fantastic postdoc advisor. She completed her undergraduate at the University of Cambridge and finished a Part II project on phylogenetic conflict under the supervision of myself and Edwige Moyroud. Holly later completed a Part III project at the Sanger Institute, working on genomics. She is now back to studying conflict, addressing it in both Carnivorous plants and Hibiscus.

### Oluwatomi Jacobs

<img src="https://walkerlab-uic.github.io/pictures/Tomi.jpeg" alt="Tomi" width="200"/>

Tomi is a first-year Ph.D. student learning the ways of UIC and developing her thesis. Tomi completed her undergraduate degree at the University of Ilorin, a Master's degree at Delaware State University, and a Thomas Wyatt Turner Fellow at Cornell University.

### Shawn Arreguin

Shawn is a first-year Ph.D. student who is co-advised with [Dr. Mary Ashley]( https://bios.uic.edu/profiles/mary-ashley/). He is working on developing his thesis, with a broad interest in urban ecosystems. Shawn completed his undergraduate degree at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.

## Undergraduate Students

### Miles Woodcock-Girard

Miles has been with us for a little over a year and is now a senior at UIC pursuing a degree in Biomedical Engineering. His work in the lab has focused on various subjects, but his primary efforts are developing and maintaining Semblans, a C++ package to efficiently and thoroughly process short-read data in transcriptomes. [Click here to check it out](https://github.com/gladshire/Semblans).

### Linda Mansour

Linda has been working in the lab since the fall of 2023. Her projects have focused on analyzing next-generation sequencing data and the quality of the reads that are produced.

## Former Lab Members

### Alexandra Siek

Alex worked in the lab as a BIOS391 student. Her project focused on transcriptome assembly and what we can do with the different programs. Alex also worked on a side project for automatically labeling phylogenetic trees with their NCBI taxonomy.


### Renée King

<img src="https://walkerlab-uic.github.io/pictures/ReneeKing.jpg" alt="Renee" width="200"/>

Renée completed her undergraduate thesis project in the lab. She analyzed how the quality of the sequencing has changed over time and what implications that may have.

### Vaishnavi Vanamala

Vivi worked on her BME 398 project in the lab, developing Python programs to summarize and manipulate phylogenetic trees.

### Pratiti Bandyopadhyay

Pratiti was an undergraduate student in the lab who completed her senior thesis with us. Her research focused on applying computational methods to the Caryophyllales. Pratiti then completed the postbacc program in this lab along with the lab of [Dr. Alex Shingleton]( https://bios.uic.edu/profiles/shingleton-alexander/) and is now pursuing her graduate degree at the University of Zurich.

### Josh Lee

Josh completed his honors capstone project, studying the phylogenetic signal associated with dentition in primates. He has now graduated and is on his way to becoming a dentist, so sadly, I'll probably never see him again.
