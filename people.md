My name is Joe Walker [faculty webpage here](https://bios.uic.edu/profiles/walker-joseph/). I received my BS from Purdue University in 2012, my Master’s degree from Purdue in 2014 (because who doesn’t want to stay in beautiful West Lafayette, Indiana), and my Ph.D. from the University of Michigan in 2018. I then went to the University of Cambridge as a research associate until 2021. Now I’m a faculty member who has the privilege of working with the folks listed on this page.

## Postdoc

### Karolis Ramanauskas

Karolis earned his Ph.D. from UIC in 2022. He is mainly working on applying population genetic methods to transcriptome datasets. However, he’s also pursuing a project disentangling why chloroplasts and mitochondria sometimes show conflicting phylogenetic signals. In his free time, he designs and maintains open-source software such as [kakapo](https://github.com/karolisr/kakapo).

## Former Lab Members

### Vaishnavi Vanamala

### Pratiti Bandyopadhyay

### Josh Lee

Josh completed his honors capstone project, studying the phylogenetic signal associated with dentition in primates. He has now graduated and is on his way to becoming a dentist, so sadly, I'll probably never see him again.
